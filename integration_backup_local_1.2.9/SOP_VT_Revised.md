# Virginia Tech Statement of Purpose - Revised Version

My journey toward systems engineering began with a fundamental question: why do some communities recover from disasters while others remain trapped in cycles of vulnerability? This question first crystallized during my undergraduate research on Hurricane Harvey's impact on Houston's socioeconomic landscape. I integrated census tract data with NPP-VIIRS satellite imagery to construct a "Social Vulnerability Index". While my multivariate regression analysis successfully quantified inequalities in recovery speeds, I realized that these static snapshots failed to capture the chaotic reality of the disaster.

However, merely quantifying vulnerability was not enough; I sought to understand how engineering decisions could actively bridge these divides. This led to my research on scaling U.S. hydrogen infrastructure, where I confronted a critical "spatial mismatch." Integrating Freight Analysis Framework (FAF5) data with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, I optimized the siting of over 600 refueling stations. The technical results were revealing: I uncovered a structural paradox where "Mega-scale" electrolysis plants led to system-wide overcapacity (utilization capped at ~69%) because their output exceeded local demand. More importantly, my spatial analysis highlighted an ethical failure: clean energy investments were concentrating in coastal wealth centers, bypassing the Great Plains—a region rich in wind potential but historically comprised of "disadvantaged communities" bearing high fossil-fuel burdens. I realized that an algorithm solely minimizing transport costs would perpetuate "energy injustice." To address this, I proposed a "dual strategy": leveraging existing LNG infrastructure for near-term access while strategically siting distributed green hydrogen hubs to uplift the Great Plains. This experience taught me that true system optimization requires finding a Pareto optimality between technical efficiency and distributional justice.

Driven by the need to operationalize such complex trade-offs, I sought to engineer algorithmic resilience within the strict constraints of logistics. In my research on the Next-Day Green Hybrid Vehicle Routing Problem (NDGVRP-TW), I confronted the limitations of static optimization in NP-hard scenarios. I initially formulated a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to balance carbon emissions with profitability, but I quickly realized that traditional metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithms suffered from premature convergence—essentially getting trapped in "static" local optima. To break this rigidity, I engineered a hybrid mPSO-SA algorithm. The critical evolution was embedding a Q-learning module into the metaheuristic framework. Instead of relying on fixed parameters, I designed the algorithm to function as an intelligent agent: it used Reinforcement Learning to autonomously "sense" the solution landscape state and dynamically tune its acceleration coefficients in real-time. This experience was pivotal; it demonstrated that for a system to be truly resilient, its underlying logic must not be merely robust, but adaptive and self-optimizing.

However, to understand the mechanisms driving real-world systems, I had to move beyond simulation to direct intervention. I founded CampusGo, a campus mobility and community engagement platform. Leading a non-technical team, I leveraged AI-assisted development to architect a full-stack system from scratch using Vue 3, Node.js, and PostgreSQL—transforming my limited coding experience into a functional product through iterative collaboration with generative AI tools. This process itself became a case study in human-AI collaboration: I learned to decompose complex features into precise prompts, debug AI-generated code, and synthesize outputs into a coherent system architecture.

The technical implementation, however, was secondary to the mechanism design challenges I encountered. Facing the classic "cold start" problem—how to bootstrap engagement on a platform with no initial user base—I designed a multi-layer incentive system grounded in behavioral economics. The core innovation was a points-based gamification framework with weekly leaderboard resets every Sunday at midnight. This temporal structure created recurring urgency cycles: users competed for top-10 positions to earn merchant coupons, but the weekly reset prevented early adopters from monopolizing rewards, keeping the competition accessible to newcomers. I further segmented the leaderboard into categories (drivers, socializers, sellers, community helpers) to recognize diverse contribution types and prevent a single engagement pattern from dominating.

To ensure authentic participation, I implemented a location-verified check-in system using GPS validation within a 100-meter radius of event locations. This mechanism addressed a fundamental trust problem in community platforms: how to verify that users actually attended activities rather than merely registering. The check-in data then fed into the points system, creating a closed loop where genuine participation was rewarded and fraudulent claims were technically impossible.

Observing the platform in use, I witnessed how algorithmic design choices triggered emergent social behaviors. A simple tweak to the consecutive login bonus multiplier (capping at 3x) shifted user engagement patterns across the entire network. The weekly reset mechanism transformed individual ride-sharing transactions into opportunities for accumulating social capital—users began coordinating carpools not just for transportation efficiency, but to climb the leaderboard together. This experience revealed that platforms often fail not due to technical bottlenecks, but because of misaligned incentives between the algorithm and human agents. I realized that to engineer truly robust sociotechnical systems, I need to combine my background in adaptive algorithms with System Dynamics and Agent-Based Modeling—tools that can simulate how micro-level incentive structures propagate into macro-level behavioral patterns.

Furthermore, my experience building CampusGo with AI tools sparked a unique perspective on the future of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Witnessing how generative AI lowered the barrier for my non-technical team—enabling them to contribute to frontend design and feature specification—I developed a conviction I call "Tech as Fast Fashion." Just as the fashion industry responds instantly to micro-trends, I believe the democratization of coding will allow engineers to deploy highly customized, "hyper-niche" interfaces for specific user groups instantly. In this future, the value of engineering shifts from building backend infrastructure to designing inclusive, adaptive user experiences that cater to diverse cognitive and emotional needs. This insight drives my desire to explore how affective computing can be integrated into system design.

The Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech offers the ideal interdisciplinary matrix to operationalize this vision. I am specifically drawn to the work of three faculty members whose research aligns with the three layers of my proposed framework:

First, I aim to work with Prof. Konstantinos Triantis to ground my understanding of macro-system resilience. My background in stochastic processes and my struggles with the static nature of the "Social Vulnerability Index" and the structural inefficiencies I found in hydrogen supply chains align perfectly with his work on dynamic performance measurement. I am eager to explore how we can integrate Fuzzy Logic into resilience modeling to quantify the "unclear" variables I encountered in both disaster recovery and energy transition planning, thereby creating models that reflect the messy reality of infrastructure failure.

Second, to address the micro-level interactions I observed in CampusGo, I seek to collaborate with Prof. Niyousha Hosseinichimeh. Her pioneering work integrating System Dynamics (SD) with AI represents the methodological breakthrough I seek. Building on my experience embedding Q-learning agents into optimization frameworks, I aim to go a step further: utilizing Generative AI agents to simulate complex, non-rational human behaviors within SD models. My background in constructing hybrid adaptive algorithms will allow me to rigorously calibrate these simulations, ensuring they capture the emergent behavioral waves I observed in the field with a granularity that traditional expert-based assumptions cannot achieve.

Finally, my interest in the "Tech as Fast Fashion" paradigm resonates deeply with Prof. Myounghoon Jeon's research in the Mind Music Machine Lab. As technical barriers vanish, I want to apply my full-stack engineering capabilities to design adaptive interfaces that bridge the gap between rigorous system logic and human emotion. I am particularly interested in how his work on affective computing and inclusive design can be applied to create "hyper-niche" experiences for neurodiverse populations within automated systems.

Ultimately, my goal is to evolve from a developer of tools to an architect of systems. By synthesizing Prof. Triantis's rigorous measurement frameworks, Prof. Hosseinichimeh's simulation methodologies, and Prof. Jeon's human-centric design philosophy, I hope to contribute to a new paradigm of systems engineering—one that is as adaptive, resilient, and human as the world it seeks to serve.
